# How to Change Minila Air to HHKB Layout

HHKB and minila Air are pretty similar in a lot of aspects. To have unified experience on both keyboards, I use Karabiner to configure Minila Air so as to be perfectly aligned with HHKB pro 2.

All my working enviornment is OSX/Linux based. The jumper setting of minila is: 2, 6 ON, others OFF.

The private.xml basically does two things:

1. Switch BACKSLASH with BACKQUOTE.
2. Use the DELETE key on the right margin as the Fn Key in HHKB so as to mimick the arrow keys behaviour.
